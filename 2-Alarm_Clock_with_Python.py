# An alarm clock is a clock with a function that can be activated to ring at a time set in advance, used to wake someone up.

# I will be using the DateTime module in Python to create an alarm clock and the sound library in Python to play the alarm sound.

# The DateTime module comes preinstalled in the Python programming language so you can easily import it in your program. The playsound library can be easily installed by using a pip command; pip install playsound.
