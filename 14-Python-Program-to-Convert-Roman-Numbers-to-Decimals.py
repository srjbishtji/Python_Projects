# One of the most favourite questions in a coding interview is to convert Roman numbers to decimals.

# How To Convert Roman Numbers to Decimals?
# Remember that the base numbers are not the numbers that are used by the Romans as they have count values such as I: 1, V: 5, X: 10, C: 100, D: 500, M: 1000, etc.

# So we need to follow the above logic to write a program to convert roman numbers to decimals with Python. So letâ€™s have a look at the process of converting roman numbers to decimals:

# 1. Work your way through the string of Roman numerals from left to right, examining two adjacent characters at a time. If you want then you can also specify that the direction of loops, but it does not matter as long as the comparisons are implemented accordingly.
# 2. If the value on the left is higher than the value on the right, then subtract the count at that position from the final value. Otherwise, just add it.
# 3. Once the process is complete, the final value is the decimal value equivalent of the roman number.


# Code :

tallies = {
    'I': 1,
    'V': 5,
    'X': 10,
    'L': 50,
    'C': 100,
    'D': 500,
    'M': 1000,
    # specify more numerals if you wish
}

def RomanNumeralToDecimal(romanNumeral):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(len(romanNumeral) - 1):
        left = romanNumeral[i]
        right = romanNumeral[i + 1]
        if tallies[left] < tallies[right]:
            sum -= tallies[left]
        else:
            sum += tallies[left]
    sum += tallies[romanNumeral[-1]]
    return sum
print(RomanNumeralToDecimal("XXVI"))
